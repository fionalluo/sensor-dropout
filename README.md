# sensor-dropout

A project for studying sensor dropout and observation space subsets in reinforcement learning environments.

## Environment Setup

This project requires setting up two main components: the grid environments and the Gymnasium Robotics environments.

### Grid Setup

1. Clone the trailenv repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fionalluo/trailenv
   ```

2. Navigate to the trailenv directory:
   ```bash
   cd trailenv
   ```

3. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Gymnasium Robotics Setup

1. Clone the Gymnasium-Robotics repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fionalluo/Gymnasium-Robotics
   ```

2. Navigate to the Gymnasium-Robotics directory:
   ```bash
   cd Gymnasium-Robotics
   ```

3. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
